# Data Professional Survey Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes survey responses from approximately 700 data professionals to gain insights into their job roles, salaries, programming language preferences, and overall satisfaction with their work-life balance and salary. The data was collected via an online survey form, cleaned in Excel, and then visualized using Power BI.

## Objectives

- Understand the demographics of data professionals.
- Analyze average salaries by job title.
- Identify the most popular programming languages among data professionals.
- Assess the difficulty level of breaking into the data field.
- Evaluate the happiness levels of data professionals with their work-life balance and salary.

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning
- The collected data was cleaned in Microsoft Excel to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
- Data was organized and prepared for analysis.

### Data Visualization
- The cleaned data was imported into Power BI for visualization.
- Various charts and graphs were created to present the findings in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## Key Findings & Visualization
The final dashboard provides an interactive view of the survey results:

- Country Distribution: This allows users to filter data by country to analyze regional trends. The majority of respondents are from the United States, followed by India and other countries. This indicates a strong presence of data professionals in these regions. 

- Average Salary by Job Title: 
    - Data Scientist: Has the highest average salary at $630K.
    - Data engineers and Data Architects follow closely with average salaries of around $50K.
    - Data Analysts and Database Developers have lower average salaries compared to the above roles.

- Favourite Programming Language: A stacked column chart displaying the count of respondents for each programming language. Findings-
    - Python is the most popular programming language among data professionals, with over 400 respondents favoring it.
    - Other languages like R, JavaScript, and Java also have a significant number of users but are less popular than Python.

- Difficulty to Break into Data: A pie chart illustrating the perceived difficulty levels of entering the data field. Findings-
    - Difficult: 24.76% of respondents find it difficult to break into the data field.
    - Very Difficult: 6.98% find it very difficult.
    - Easy: 21.43% find it easy.
    - Very Easy: 42.86% find it very easy.

- Happiness Metrics: Gauges showing the average ratings for work-life balance and salary satisfaction. Findings-
    - Happiness with Work-Life Balance: Respondents rate their happiness with work-life balance at an average of 5.74 out of 10.
    - Happiness with Salary: The average happiness with salary is rated at 4.27 out of 10.

## Conclusion
This project offers valuable insights into the current state of the data professional community. It highlights the importance of Python as a programming language, the high salaries associated with data science roles, and the varying levels of difficulty in breaking into the field. The dashboard serves as a useful tool for stakeholders to understand the trends and challenges faced by data professionals.

## Future Work
- Expand the survey to include more respondents for a broader perspective.
- Incorporate additional factors such as education level, years of experience, and industry type to refine the analysis.
- Use advanced analytics techniques to uncover deeper correlations within the data.
